# Conclusion

Hopefully this mini-book has allowed you to kick the tires with jupyter-book and decide if it fits your needs. At this point you should be able to rename your repo/book and start writing your own book immediately! Here are a couple possible next steps:
1. Build both the html and pdf outputs to ensure everything still looks as you would expect
    - HTML: `jupyter-book build book`
    - PDF: `jupyter-book build book --builder pdflatex`
1. Catch up on what was omitted in this mini-book. Jupyter-book can do much more than what was shown here, this mini-book intentionally just focused on the minimum subset needed for writing. Consider learning more about:
    - Writing with [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyterbook.org/content/code-outputs.html)
    - [Markdown vs Markedly Structured Text (MyST) ](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html)
    - [Formatting code outputs](https://jupyterbook.org/content/code-outputs.html)
    - Two ways to make jupyter-books interactive: [one](https://jupyterbook.org/interactive/launchbuttons.html), [two](https://jupyterbook.org/interactive/interactive.html)
1. The [official jupyter-book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) is superb, a good read through will help you make the best use of jupyter-book
1. There are a lot of possible ways to configure jupyter-book, consider fine [tuning your configuration](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
1. Learn to collaborate with git. For the sake of simplicity I didn't delve into the git workflow. Collaborating with git is however a major benefit of working with text based files and the jupyter ecosystem.
1. Give the core [team](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/team.html) a big thanks for making jupyter-book possible!
1. Did you spot an error or have a problem following along with this mini-book? Please leave a comment or make a pull request.
